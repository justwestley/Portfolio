# Final Project - Part 2 

### Wireframes

I chose to construct my wireframes on Shorthand - the link to which can be found here: https://preview.shorthand.com/v4ZePL4ZyPFAZJ4N 

The thematic elements of my story remained largely consistent with my early story-boarding. Although the sections are not as clearly defined as they were in the outline, I tried my best to organize the structure in the similar “setup, conflict, resolution” model presented in Good Charts. 

However, the data visualizations themselves proved to be more difficult than I anticipated. I wanted to begin digitally constructing the visualizations rather than sketching, because I wanted to see if my initial ideas were even possible. This was a smart idea as my main visualization concept - a map with pie charts displaying each museum’s perspective demographic data - proved to be quite challenging to make in tableau. I spent several hours on creating such a chart, but eventually, I had to step away from the concept as it became clear I would not finish by the due date. 

I then tried to pivot to a grid of pie charts in Fourish. Again, I struggled with the design elements. The labels and format kept being difficult to read. Further, because the data was similar from museum to museum the subtle differences were difficult to discern. After a short amount of effort, I chose to pivot one more time. 

I turned to Infogram and decided on an interactable series of donut charts. This enabled the user to easily compare museums and notice the slight shifts in proportions by way of the animations. In order to highlight the proportions of the chart that represented the marginalized categories, I used grey for the majority proportions and bright colors for the minority proportions. These visualizations were paired with simple charts that were also created in Infogram.

### User Feedback

The target audience for my story is the museum-going public. Rather than focusing on professionals, I wanted to present the information in a way that would be helpful for the average art-lover. Museums often try to present an outward facing image of progressivism and typically hide the disparities in their collections. By directing my story at average museum patrons, I want to make museum-goers more empowered to ask for more from their art institutions.

Because of a short time-frame as well as the Thanksgiving break, I was unable to reach a broad sample of users to test my wireframe, however I was able to reach out to five friends, all of which love museums. 

I asked them to respond to these questions after scrolling through my wireframes: 

1. On a scale of 1-5, how clear were the data visualizations? 
2. On a scale of 1-5, how successful was the flow of the story? 
3. Was there ever a moment, where you paused to wonder what you were looking at?   
4. Were you ever confused by the structure of the story? Would you restructure anything? 
5. Any other comments or suggestions? 

The responses revealed a couple of things. First, the beginning of my story needs refinement. One responder felt that the Culture Track data was unnecessary. Another felt I could couple the introduction of collections management as a practice with DEAI issues more obviously. Other notes included adding more information about Decolonize This Place (social media, donation information, etc) in my call to action and making the name of the “Art Museum Staffing, People of Color” chart to something more descriptive. However, most of my feedback was positive. People liked the overall structure of my story and enjoyed the interactivity of the main visualizations. 

Moving forward, I plan on editing the beginning of my story to better set up the problem I am trying to explain, writing clearer chart titles, and improving the call to action.
