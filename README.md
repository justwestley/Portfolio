# Westley-Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data (Fall 2020) at Carnegie Mellon University

# About me
My name is Justin Westley (he/him), and I am a second-year Master of Arts Management student at CMU's Heinz College. Before starting at Heinz, I earned a Bachelor of Music in Voice and Music History at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. Over the summer, I interned with Creative Time, a public art organization based in New York City, working in their development department. After graduation, I hope to continue working in development at art and cultural nonprofits, specifically at organizations with missions related to advancing arts access.

# What I hope to learn
I'm interested in learning new ways to:
 - Visualize data for grant applications and final/renewal reporting
 - Present data in marketing materials to individual donors and corporate partners
 - Use data to advise board members on development related policy and strategy
