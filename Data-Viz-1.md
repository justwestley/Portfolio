## Financial Sustainability and the Debt-to-GDP Ratio 
From 1995 to 2019, financial stability was more common internationally than you might think

## Japan's National Debt Stands out Among G10 Countries
Over a 20-year period, the G10's only Asiatic member has seen their Debt-to-GDP ratio rise, signaling a growing risk of default even when compared with similar economies.

## Takaways

The first visualization captures a snapshot in time. Tt demonstrates which countries had the highest and lowest debt-to-GDP ratios in 2019 and presents a useful picture of which countries may be at risk for default in that year. However, by offering such a limited time-frame, the chart doesn't give a picture of each countryâ€™s financial health overall. Sure Greece has a high ratio, but is this an outlier or a trend?

The second visualization presents this context though a line chart. Now it is clear if a country is spiking, plateauing, or dropping. However, the immediate observation I had was how stable most of the ratios were. While there are some significant outliers, most countries do not see large shifts in their ratios. Narrowing my observations to even finer specificity was slightly more difficult in this visualization. By offering such a long list of countries, the information became slightly overwhelming. Reducing the number of countries included in the visualization became by next step.

In my third visualization, I chose to reduce the countries to the eleven members of G10. Japan is a country that has seen a significant increase in their ratio over the past twenty years, and I wanted to compare this growth with other nations with similarly industrial economies. I chose a donut chart to capture this because it is easily suited for visualizing proportions. This functionality was at first impaired by the number of years I included in the visualization as the growth was difficult to visually distinguish. To accomodate, I reduced the number of years in order to more clearly show this growth. Finally, I highlighted Japan in an eye-grabbing red and used a neutral grey on the other member-nations to further highlight the change over time.
