# Critique by Design 

## Original Visualization: 

This chart is taken from a 2017 report by the National Endowment of the Arts studying arts and cultural participation in the United States. I selected this chart in part because the NEA provides publically available data sets, but also because audience development continues to be one of the top challanges facing arts organizations today. Being aware of national averages is essential for benchmarking an organization's success. Unfortuanetly, I found this chart to be confusing.  First, the clumping of bars around each activity-type isn’t quite clear. While there is a significant amount of space between the “Any artistic, creative, and cultural activity” category and the first activity-type, the rest are grouped close together, making it difficult to separate at first glance. Second, the “total bar” in these groupings is particularly confusing. It represents the total number of people who participated in the activity while the bars beneath further break down that number by gender. This isn’t explained by the visualization and isn’t necessarily relevant to the story the visualization is seeking to tell. Third, the use of color is unintuitive. If a “total bar” needed to be included, grey seems like a less distracting choice than the green. Further, it appears the designers intentionally avoided gendered colors when assigning colors to the male and female bars. This is a decent idea, but yellow and purple are not immediately recognizable gender markers. Because the key is so low on the chart, the eye has to repeatedly travel to decode the information.
