# Final Project - Part 1 

## Art Museum Collections don’t Paint a Picture of their Public 

### Summary 
Collections in Major U.S. art museums overly represent work by white and male artists from North America from Europe, failing to represent the lives and stories of the diverse, metropolitan communities they reside. This problem is likely linked with the diversity of museum staff, particularly in leadership, curation, education, and conservation. I’m interested in showing the demographic proportions of 18 major U.S. art museum collections (ethnicity, gender, and geographic origin), linking these disparities with racial disparities in art museum administration, and highlighting organizations working to reform these structural problems.

### Project Structure 
1. Set Up
     -  People like participating in cultural activities (such as museum attendance) because they value “experiencing new things” and “learning new things.” 

2. Conflict
    - On the basis of ethnicity, gender, and geographic origin, major U.S. art museum collections are largely homogenous. 
    - Art museum administration is also racially homogenous (majority white) particularly in the fields of curation, education, conservation, as well as leadership. 

3. Conflict Resolved
    - Organizations like Decolonize This Place are working to bring awareness and action to these issues and beyond at art and cultural organizations across the country. 
    - Social Media like Instagram’s @changethemuseum highlight stories of POC employees at major U.S. museums.
    - Provide website information to stay informed and get involved. 

### Sketches
For the series of charts built from my primary data set, I plan on mapping the 18 museums onto a map of the United States and using pie graphs to visualize the relevant demographic proportions.

In regards to my secondary data sources, I will use a half donut chart to translate the Culture Track data and bar charts to capture the staff demographaphic survey data.

### Data
The primary data set is from a 2019 study by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the Association of Art Museum Directors Secondary data includes responses from the Andew W. Mellon Foundation’s Art Museum Staff Demographic Survey 2018 and LaPacha Cohen’s Culture Track 2017. 

I will use the primary data set to visualize the disparities on the basis of ethnicity, gender, and geographic origin at 18 major U.S. art museums. While the data set itself is presented in a set of static tables, I will transfer the information into an excel sheet in order to manipulate it. The secondary data will be taken from simple infographics presented in both the Art Museum Staff Demographic Survey 2018 and Culture Track 2017. These visualizations will support the story being told by primary data set by demonstrating how a homogenous collection is undesirable to visitors and outlining how these disparities may be protected by majority-white leadership and administration.
