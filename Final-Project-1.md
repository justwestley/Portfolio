### Final Project - Part 1 

## Art Museum Collections don’t Paint a Picture of their Public 

# Summary 
Collections in Major U.S. art museums overly represent work by white and male artists from North America from Europe, failing to represent the lives and stories of the diverse, metropolitan communities they reside. This problem is likely linked with the diversity of museum staff, particularly in leadership, curation, education, and conservation. I’m interested in showing the demographic proportions of 18 major U.S. art museum collections (ethnicity, gender, and geographic origin), linking these disparities with racial disparities in art museum administration, and highlighting organizations working to reform these structural problems.
